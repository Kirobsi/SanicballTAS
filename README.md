# Sanicball

Sanicball is discontinued and I will not be accepting any pull requests.
However if you have trouble understanding parts the project structure or code you can message me directly (viciousbadger@protonmail.com), I'll try to help out.

The project is to be opened with Unity3D. It works best with version 5.3.5f1 of the editor (Available here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). If you use a newer version, Unity will attempt to upgrade the project, which will most likely leave a ton of bugs for you to fix first.

Also check out https://github.com/BK-TN/SanicballServerList, which lets you host a server list for the game.

[note from Kirobsi: the above is unchanged. This repo exists solely to make public the modifications I made to Sanicball to make TASing it through libTAS more stable. It was effectively unusable before. As such, there's no reason to compile this on anything but Linux. Furthormore, there's at least one bug caused by this mod which I will not fix, simply because it doesn't affect TASes: the in-race timer & certain objects (excluding the player) keep moving while paused. There's no reason to pause in a TAS unless the race is already over. I'll try to fix this if that ever changes.]
